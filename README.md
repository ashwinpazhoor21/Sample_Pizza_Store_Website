## Description

This project is a food ordering system made entirely functional in django. 
I used bootstrap 4 besides python to better control all DOM elements. 
No javascript was used to make this project. 

*index.html* *login.html* *signin.html* *menu.html* extends *layout.html* file 
*my_orders.html* and *orders_manager* shows list of all the orders
*models.py* contain all data structures
*urls.py* contain routes to functions
*views.py* cotain main program and fuctions which renders html files

Also, in static folder there are pictures and style.css file which contain additional styling for html 

Software generated superuser account automatically at first start 

My personal touch enables website administrators to mark orders as complete and allow users to see their pending or completed orders status
